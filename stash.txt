Differences between git commit and git stash:

1. git commit:
   - Records changes to the repository.
   - Creates a new commit in the project history.
   - Changes are permanent and can be pushed to a remote repository.

2. git stash:
   - Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed.
   - Moves the changes out of the working directory and into a stash stack.
   - Changes can be reapplied or discarded later.
