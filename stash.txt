Differences between git commit and git stash
Git Commit vs Git Stash:

1. git commit is used to save tracked changes to the local repository permanently.
2. git stash temporarily stores both tracked and untracked changes in a stack-like storage.
3. Commits are visible in git log; stashes are visible in git stash list.
4. Commits form part of project history; stashes are intended for short-term work interruption.
