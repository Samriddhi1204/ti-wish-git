git stash and git commit are both commands in Git that serve different purposes:
1. git stash:
- The git stash command is used to temporarily store changes that you don't want to commit immediately.
  It allows you to save your work in progress without committing it to the repository.
- When you run git stash, Git will store your local modifications in a "stash" stack. 
  This stack allows you to save multiple stashes and apply them later.

2. git commit:
- The git commit command is used to save the changes to the local repository. When you run git commit, 
  you are creating a snapshot of your changes that becomes a part of the project's history.
- Commits are permanent and are typically used to save a stable version of 
  your work or to mark a specific point in the project's development.
