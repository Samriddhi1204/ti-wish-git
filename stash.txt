git commit:
Creates a permanent snapshot of your current working directory changes.
Adds the snapshot (commit) to the Git history of our branch.
Ideal for saving changes that are ready to integrate into your project's main branch.
git stash:
Temporarily shelves our uncommitted changes.
Allows us to switch branches or work on something else without losing our progress.
Useful when we need to switch contexts but don't want to commit incomplete work.
