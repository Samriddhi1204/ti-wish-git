git commit:
    Saves our changes permanently in the Git repository history.
    Makes our changes visible to others who collaborate on the project.
    Cannot be easily undone without using commands like git revert.
git stash:
    Temporarily saves our uncommitted changes in a separate area (stash).
    Doesn't affect the current working directory or Git history.
    Allows us to switch between different tasks or revert to a clean working directory without losing our work.
