Git cherry-pick is used to choose one or more existing commit from one branch and apply it to another branch.
This is in contrast with other ways such as merge and rebase which normally apply all commits that are not there
in the current branch. Cherry-pick is mainly used if you donâ€™t want to merge the whole branch and you want some
of the commits.
