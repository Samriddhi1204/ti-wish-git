Git cherry-pick is used to choose one or more existing commit from one branch and apply it to another branch. 
It is very useful when we do not want to merge the whole branch and only want some of the commits.

Some of its uses are:
1. Undoing changes and lost commits.
2. To avoid useless conficts.
