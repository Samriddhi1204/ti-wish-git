+Differences between git commit and git stash
+Git Commit vs Git Stash:
+
+1. git commit is used to save tracked changes to the local repository permanently.
+2. git stash temporarily stores both tracked and untracked changes in a stack-like storage.
+3. Commits are visible in git log; stashes are visible in git stash list.
+4. Commits form part of project history; stashes are intended for short-term work interruption.
